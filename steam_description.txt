[h3]Stellaris compatibility: 3.2.x[/h3]

Makes a few changes to diplomatic constants, mostly revolving around favors and the galactic community timers:

[h2]Favors[/h2]
[list]
[*] [b]Influence cost[/b] to call in favors in the galactic community reduced to [b]5 influence/favor[/b] (from vanilla 10). This keeps the cost relatively consistent with halved voting cooldowns.
[/list]

[h2]Resolution timers[/h2]
[i]Halved timers in the galactic community compared to vanilla to make progress more dynamic. Halved voting cooldown to accommodate the shorter voting.[/i]
[list]
[*] [b]Resolution voting time[/b]  set to 720 days (from vanilla 1440)
[*] [b]Senate recess[/b] set to 360 days (from vanilla 720)
[*] [b]Voting cooldown[/b] set to 60 days (from vanilla 120)
[*] [b]Council election cooldown[/b] set to 3600 days (from vanilla 7200)
